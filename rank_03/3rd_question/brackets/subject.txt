Write a program that takes an undefined number of strings as arguments. For each
argument, the program prints on the standard output "OK" followed by a newline 
if the expression is correctly bracketed, otherwise it prints "Error" followed by
a newline.

Symbols considered as 'brackets' are brackets '(' and ')', square brackets '[' 
and ']'and braces '{' and '}'. Any other symbols are simply ignored.

An opening bracket must always be closed by the good closing bracket in the 
correct order. A string that does not contain any bracket is considered a 
correctly bracketed string.

If there are no arguments, the program must print only a newline.

Examples :

$> ./brackets '(johndoe)' | cat -e
OK$
$> ./brackets '([)]' | cat -e
Error$
$> ./brackets '' '{[(0 + 0)(1 + 1)](3*(-1)){()}}' | cat -e
OK$
OK$
$> ./brackets | cat -e
