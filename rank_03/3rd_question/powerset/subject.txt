Write a program that takes an integer n followed by a set s of distinct integers
as arguments.

Your program should display all the subsets of s whose sum of elements is n.

The order of the lines is not important, but the order of the elements in a
subset must match the order in the initial set s.

This way, you should not have any duplicates(example '1, 2' and '2, 1' are not
valid)

For example: ./powerset 5 1 2 3 4 5
valid output:
1 4
2 3
5
invalid output:
3 2
4 1

More examples:
./powerset 3 1 0 2 4 5 3
3
0 3
1 2
1 0 2
./powerset 12 5 2 1 8 4 3 7 11
8 4
1 11
1 4 7
1 8 3
2 3 7
5 7
5 4 3
5 2 1 4
./powerset 0 1 -1
("\n")
1 -1
In case of malloc error your program should exit with the code 1.
We will not test with invalid sets.
HINT: The empty subset is a valid subset of any set and will be displayed as an
empty line(see example ./powerset 0 1 -1).
